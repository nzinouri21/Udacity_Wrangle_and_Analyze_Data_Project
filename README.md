Repo for Udacity's data wrangling project as part of data analyst  Nanodegree

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this WeRateDogs tewwts datasets.

## The Data
The dataset that is used is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets. Rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) is extracted from each tweet's text to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, the data is filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).

### Additional Data via the Twitter API
Retweet count and favorite count are gathered from Twitter's API using the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it.
